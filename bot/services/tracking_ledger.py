"""Which order files the bot has already converted — so a second copy is noticed.

The warehouse habit that motivates this file: the same export is sent twice (someone
else already ran it, or the chat scrolled away). A silent re-run is not harmless —
the owner ends up with two identical import files and luck decides which one reaches
the tracking system. So every processed file leaves a fingerprint here, and a repeat
is answered with the earlier result plus a button that says «باز هم انجامش بده».

Only the fingerprint and the counts are stored: no barcodes, no names, no addresses.
The file's content belongs to the shop's own system, and a JSON under ``data/`` is not
a database to copy an order table into.

Like the product ledger, this is a bounded ring (:data:`MAX_ENTRIES`): a file that was
processed before the window simply stops being recognised as a repeat, which is the
accepted trade for a file the owner can delete without breaking anything.
