"""The one HTTP layer for the shop: auth, timeouts, retry policy, redaction (plan 4.1).

Before this module existed, four files each opened their own ``httpx.AsyncClient``:

* :mod:`bot.services.woocommerce_direct` — the writer (query-string auth, 45 s, its own
  retry loop, ``follow_redirects``, connection limits);
* :mod:`bot.services.woocommerce` — the diagnostics ping (10 s, the same two auth params
  copy-pasted, and *no* retry, so a 502 from a busy host read as "credentials broken");
* :mod:`bot.services.woocommerce_product_test` and :mod:`bot.services.wordpress_media` —
  the 🔧 tools (20 s / 15 s, Basic auth for the media route).

That meant four definitions of "how we talk to WooCommerce": one shared ``User-Agent``
string written two different ways, the consumer secret assembled by hand in two places,
and a retry policy that only existed in the writer. The client below owns all of it, and
the modules above now differ only in *what* they ask for.

The retry policy is the one part where this file deliberately changes behaviour. The old
``_post_transient`` retried ``POST /products`` on 500/502/504 — and a 502 from a proxy in
front of PHP usually means *the request was applied and the answer was lost*. Retrying it
created a second product. So the rule here is narrow and the same for every caller:

* a **connect error** is retried for any method — nothing was sent, nothing was applied;
* a **429** is retried for any method — the shop said "not now", and processed nothing;
* **502/503/504** are retried for idempotent methods only (a repeated read or a repeated
  ``PUT`` of the same payload cannot double a change);
* a **timeout is never retried**. On a 45-second socket that is minutes of the admin
  staring at nothing, and on a write it is exactly the ambiguous case.

The ambiguous write is handled one layer up instead, where it belongs: the content-addressed
batch id and the resume hunt in :mod:`bot.services.publish_batch` top up the half-made
product rather than adding a second one.
