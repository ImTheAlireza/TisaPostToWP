"""The last products the bot read, kept so a rule can be tested before it is used.

Self-learning is a promise about the *future*: «از این به بعد این‌طور می‌خوانم».
The only honest way to check that promise before it takes effect is to run the
new rule on the products that were just read and show what would have happened —
which is what :mod:`bot.services.learning_impact` does with this corpus.

What is stored per product is the smallest thing that makes a replay possible: the
text, what the parser read out of it (title, price, models, attribute values) and
the resulting variation count. Nothing else is kept, and nothing is uploaded:
the same product text already lives in the ledger cards' report, in the same
git-ignored ``data/`` directory.

The corpus is a ring buffer of ``MAX_ENTRIES`` items. It is deliberately *not* a
history of everything: a preview that replays 500 products would be slow, and the
question the owner is asking is «آیا این قاعده روی محصولاتِ این روزهای من
خرابکاری می‌کند؟».
