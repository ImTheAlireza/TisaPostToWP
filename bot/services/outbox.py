"""A durable queue for publishes the shop refused *because it was busy* (plan 4.8).

Why a queue exists at all: one publish is several requests (media → product → variations).
When the store answers 429 or 5xx, the retry policy inside :mod:`bot.services.woo_client`
has already spent its three tries in about fifteen seconds, and the seller's only remaining
option was «دوباره بزن» — by hand, minutes later, for every product of a bulk day. The
outbox turns that into something the bot keeps on its own: the attempt is stored with its
images and its batch id, and retried on a schedule until it succeeds or gives up.

Two boundaries keep it honest:

* **not a second publish path.** Enqueue happens only on a *transient* failure, and the drain
  calls the same :func:`bot.services.woocommerce_direct.create_draft` with the same batch id —
  so a queued retry that lands twice still cannot create two products (see
  :mod:`bot.services.publish_batch`);
* **not a state store for the conversation.** Images are *copied* into ``data/outbox_files/``
  when the item is queued, because the session workspace is deleted the moment the flow ends;
  a queue that points at deleted files is a queue that fails at 3 a.m.

Giving up is a recorded outcome, not a deleted row: the item stays with ``status='dropped'``
and the last error, and the publish card in the history is finished as a failure.
