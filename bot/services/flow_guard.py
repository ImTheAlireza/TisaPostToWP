"""One active flow per user: starting something new closes what was open.

Two half-finished flows in one chat were a real failure mode — a product with
three images from a *different* product, or an abandoned compression workspace
eating /tmp. The user's mental model is obviously «one thing at a time»; the
code just never enforced it.

Why this is a registry instead of ``ConversationHandler`` plumbing: PTB 21.11
has no public API to end another conversation for a user (the tracker is private
and there is no ``exit_conversation``). So we cannot make the framework forget a
state — but we can and do close the flow's *work*: its session, its temp files,
its half-built draft. A stale button of the abandoned flow then lands on a
handler that finds no session and says so, instead of quietly resuming
(see ``bot.modules.product_flow._session_of``).

A flow registers a closer, and calls :func:`close_others` in its own entry point.
