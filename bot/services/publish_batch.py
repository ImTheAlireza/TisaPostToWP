"""Identity of one publish attempt: the same input must never become two products.

Why a hash of the content and not a uuid: a uuid has to survive the crash, and a crash in
the middle of a publish (media uploaded → product POSTed → response lost) is exactly the
case this guards. Content-addressing means the retry recomputes the *same* id from the
same draft — there is nothing to persist and nothing to lose.

The id is written into the shop as product meta (``tisa_batch_id``) so that a half-finished
publish can be found again from the store's side too, not only from our JSON. The importer
plugin (``tisa-product-importer.zip``) reads the same id from ``product.json`` and refuses
to import a package it has already imported.
