"""Self-learning memory for the owner's corrections.

When the bot misreads something and the owner fixes it, the fix should not be
lost with the session — and it should not be memorized as a one-off either.
This module turns a correction into the *narrowest rule that still generalizes*:

``price_scale``
    A bare price was off by a power of ten: ``1098`` was read as 1,098 and
    corrected to 1,098,000, so a bare 4-digit amount means "thousands".
    Next time ``1298`` is read as 1,298,000 with no help.

``term``
    One word was replaced by another (a color, a brand spelling, a title word):
    «سلفی» -> «مشکی». Applied to attribute values and title tokens later.

Everything else is still recorded in ``corrections`` (a bounded log) so the
owner can see what the bot was told, even when no safe rule could be inferred.

**A learned rule is a proposal, not a law.** One generalization rewrites every
later product, and the mistake that hurts is the one that is silent: a term rule
that merges two colors quietly deletes a variation from the catalog and nothing
in the chat says so. So a fresh rule is saved as ``pending`` and changes nothing
until the owner confirms it, and the confirmation message states what the rule
*would have done* to the recent products — see :mod:`bot.services.learning_impact`,
which replays the rule over the corpus in ``data/learning_corpus.json``.

A rule also carries where it should apply (``scope``): shop-wide, or only when a
word (the category it was learned in) appears in the text being parsed.

Rules live in ``data/learned.json`` (git-ignored, like ``roles.json``) and are
managed from the «🧠 یادگیری» screen, because a memory that cannot be edited is
a liability.

Storage format ``version: 2``. A ``version: 1`` file is read as before with two
decisions: its rules are already trusted (``active`` — the owner has been relying
on them) and their scope is the whole shop.
