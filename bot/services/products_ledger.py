"""What the bot published recently — and the card that explains it.

A publish used to end in one line of «✅ ساخته شد» that scrolled away: no id, no
link, no variation count, and no way back to the draft afterwards. This ledger is
the small durable store of those result cards (the last few), read by the card
itself («🧾 گزارش») and by «🧾 آخرین محصولات» in the main menu.

Only facts go in here — values that were really sent to WooCommerce, never what
the bot hoped for. A failed publish is recorded too (``status="failed"`` with the
error), because «سایت که خالی است» is the most common question after a crash, and
the honest answer is in this file.

Statuses: ``created`` / ``zip`` / ``failed`` / ``dry`` (a rehearsal, plan 4.1) /
``pending`` — the intent written before the first request, which is what makes a
crash mid-publish recoverable instead of duplicated (plan 4.3).

The store is bounded (:data:`MAX_ENTRIES`): when a very long stretch of publishes
pushes an old card out, the duplicate check for that product simply forgets it.
That is the accepted trade — history deep enough to matter lives in the shop's own
database, not in a JSON file the owner may delete.


The store is plain JSON on purpose (see :mod:`bot.services.jsonstore`): it is
small, human-readable, and deleting it costs nothing but history.
