"""Feature modules.

Each module is self-contained and exposes exactly one function:

    def register(app: telegram.ext.Application) -> None

which attaches its handlers (CommandHandler, CallbackQueryHandler,
ConversationHandler, ...) to the application.

To add a new feature:
  1. create bot/modules/<feature>.py with a register() function
  2. add its callback-data constants to bot/constants.py
  3. add its button to the relevant keyboard in bot/keyboards/
  4. append the module to ALL_MODULES below

Order matters: `fallback` must stay last, since it catches anything
the other modules didn't handle.
